# CNN Emotion Detection

## Introduction
This project is focused on detecting human emotions using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It leverages the power of deep learning to analyze facial expressions and classify them into various emotion categories. The core of this project is built using Keras and TensorFlow, showcasing the practical application of CNNs in real-world scenarios.

## Features
- Emotion classification using a CNN model.
- Real-time emotion detection from webcam feed.
- Detailed analysis and visualization of the detection process.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Pip (Python package installer)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Zatch07/CNN-Emotion-Detection.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd CNN-Emotion-Detection

3. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt


### Running the Project
To run the emotion detection model, execute the following command:

    python main.py

This will start the application and begin detecting emotions using your webcam.

## Built With
- [Keras](https://keras.io/) - The deep learning framework used
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) - Backend for Keras
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) - Used for capturing and processing webcam feed

## Model Information
The model architecture and training process are detailed in the Jupyter notebook `emotion-classification-cnn-using-keras.ipynb`.
